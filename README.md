# Cableties and Hostages

![banner](https://github.com/theokrueger-diesel-mods/pd2-cableties-hostages/raw/master/thumbs/banner.png)

**Requires [BeardLib](https://modworkshop.net/mod/14924) for auto updates, install to mods/**

This mod will give you access to a much greater supply of cable ties and allows you to have a greater number of following hostages. 
This mod also allows you to set the movement speed of following hostages (default 1.3x). 

**You need the Forced Friendship basic skill for increased cable ties to work**

This mod works as **host only** and will announce itself to those who connect to your lobby (can be disabled for friends-only or private games).
Restart heist for settings to take effect.

**[Harder Cop Dominations by Rokk](https://modworkshop.net/mod/28982)**
To make domination almost make sense and reduce hostage spam meta

**[Hostage Pathing Fix by Schmuddel](https://modworkshop.net/mod/16753)**
To make hostages actually come to you, reducing hostage management frustration

**[Iter by TdlQ](https://pd2mods.z77.fr/iter.html)**
To make AI pathfinding more efficient and effective.
Pairs nicely with [Full Speed Swarm](https://pd2mods.z77.fr/full_speed_swarm.html), which increases difficulty in loud heists

**[Keep It Clean! by TdlQ](https://pd2mods.z77.fr/keep_it_clean.html)**
To actually punish civilian killing with everyone's favourite *random chance*

**[Moveable Intimidated Cop by TdlQ](https://pd2mods.z77.fr/moveable_intimidated_cop.html)**
To better accommodate pacifist stealth runs

**[Please, Go There by TdlQ](https://pd2mods.z77.fr/please_go_there.html)**
To allow directing of hostages with waypoints instead of your body.
Note this does not pair well with [Hostage Pathing Fix](https://modworkshop.net/mod/16753) so choose one

  <summary><b>F.A.Q.</b></summary>

**Q: Will this mark me as a cheater?**
  
A: No, it will not. But people might question why you have 52 cable ties in your inventory, so it announces it in chat and only works as a host.
This setting can be turned off, but be warned it may lead to unhappy players.

**Q: Can this work if I'm not hosting?**
  
A: This mod does not work if you aren't hosting. There are other mods out there that will give you extra cable ties while you *aren't* hosting,
but no mod can allow you additional hostage followers or increase their movement speed as a client.

**Q: Why did you make this mod if alternatives exist**
  
A: This mod provides customizability and an all-in-one 'solution' to the unnecessary challenge of clean gameplay

**Q: Can I turn off the announce feature so others don't have to see I'm using this mod?**
  
A: As of update 1.2, you can turn the announce feature off in Mod Options -> Cable Ties and Hostages
This will **ONLY** disable announcements in friends-only or private games.
It was a joint-decision between me and the modteam to change this.

**Q: Can this mod integrate *feature* in a future update?**
  
A: Put a request in the comments, or better yet add it yourself and submit a pull request in the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/theokrueger-diesel-mods/pd2-cableties-hostages)!
